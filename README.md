# OOP Using Python

Welcome! This repository contains a simple project that demonstrates and explains the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using **Python**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simplify and help you understand key OOP concepts such as Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Abstraction through practical examples involving classes like:

- `Person`  
- `Employee`  
- `Car`  
- `Office`

## üêç Why Python?

Python is an easy and flexible language, but it implements OOP concepts differently compared to languages like Java or C++. For example:

- No explicit **Method Overloading** support.  
- Access Modifiers (Private, Protected) are not strictly enforced.  
- Supports **Multiple Inheritance** like C++!  
- Flexible usage of **Static Members & Methods**.

## üìö What's Inside

- Class definitions and their relationships.  
- Demonstrations of inheritance and usage of methods and properties.  
- Examples of static methods and class methods.  
- Realistic scenarios (e.g., office management system with employees and cars).
